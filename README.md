## About

PICI (*Peer Innovation Community Indicators*) is an open source toolbox that simplifies creating and measuring indicators of innovation in online communities. It is intended for use in a research context and allows researchers to:

- automate data collection and indicator generation steps 
- simplify the implementation of new indicators
- simplify the assessment of new communities with an arbitrary "digital footprint"
- make the generation and evaluation of indicators reproducible
- provide a repository of documented & evaluated indicators of innovation in online communities

PICI is part of the [Peer Innovation research project](https://www.peer-innovation.de/).

*Currently under development. A first release is planned for Q4 2022.*
