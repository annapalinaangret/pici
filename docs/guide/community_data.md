# Community data collection

The toolbox makes online forums usable as a data source for the investigation of peer communities. The forum data can be provided as a file or extracted dynamically. Each forum post forms a data point, which is identified e.g. by timestamp, reply content, contributor ID and the corresponding thread.

### Principles	

For further processing, the Toolbox requires a certain data structure that records the time of contribution, the reply content, a unique contributor and the associated thread for each forum post. The data model links the table of individual contributions (posts) with a table of contributors (authors) and a table with information on the discussion threads. The three data tables form the basis for the analysis of online interactions in peer communities. They are available as files or are dynamically extracted from publicly accessible online forums adapted to the respective data source.
