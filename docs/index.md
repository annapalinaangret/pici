**Pici** (*Peer Innovation Community Indicators*) is a toolbox that simplifies creating and measuring innovation indicators in different online communities. It is implemented in Python and intended to use with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

The toolbox is a result of the [Peer Innovation research project](https://www.peer-innovation.de/english/) by the [Institute for Ecological Economy Research (IÃ–W)](https://www.ioew.de/en/) in collaboration with the [Chair of Innovation Economics](https://www.inno.tu-berlin.de/menue/chair_of_innovation_economics/) at [Technical University Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/). It was financed by the [German Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/).
